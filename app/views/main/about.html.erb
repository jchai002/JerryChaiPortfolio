    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    I was born in Beijing, China, and I moved to the U.S. with my family when I was twelve. I spent most of my teenager years in the Sillicon Valley, right after the internet bubble of the late 1990s bursted. Although I used computers everyday, I didn't really consider a career working with computers. I developed an interest in Biology during high school, so I pursued a biochemistry degree in college.</p>
    <p>
    My Alma Mater is UCSD, in the sunny souther California city of San Diego. I earned a diploma in Biochemistry and graduated in 2013. After university I managed to get into medical school at LECOM, in Erie, PA. After a year of medical school, I decided to take a break and try my hand at something more creative and flexible. Which is why I decided to start studying software development at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
    <p>
    With my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and various physical activities. I have a pretty oddball collection of hobbies, such as improv comedy, djaying, snowboarding, and dancing. </p>
